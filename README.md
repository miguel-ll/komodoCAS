## Features

### Algebra

- Root finding algorithms (Secant's method, Laguerre's method, Brent's method, Steffensen's method). Although such methods as Newton's and Halley's are consistent and famous, they require to take the first and/or second derivatives, which consumes more computer resources.
- Get the nth bernoulli number using the bernoulli function.

### Calculus

- Numerical integration methods (Gaussian quadrature, Monte Carlo integration, trapezoid rule, Simpson's rule, Weedle's rule).

### Special functions

- Gamma function, log gamma.

### Complex numbers

- Complex trigonometric and logarithm functions, such as: complex sin, cos, tan, log, etc.

## TODO

- implement a function similar to triu() in trix.py.
- implement some matrix functions (sqrtm for example).
